# Review Findings Backlog (parking lot)

Findings from the 2026-07-19 multi-agent review that are **deliberately not in any active plan** (`../history/search-and-fixes.md`, `../history/embeddings.md`, `../history/markdown-import-export.md`). Each entry names its trigger — the event that should promote it into a plan. Do not implement from this file directly.

## Correctness / robustness

- **`http://` server URLs accepted end-to-end** (`src-tauri/src/settings.rs:234`, `crates/notes-sync/src/transport.rs:425`): bearer token travels plaintext if the reverse proxy is misconfigured. _Trigger: cheap — require https unless host is localhost/LAN, or show a persistent warning badge; fold into the next server/security batch (Track C follow-up)._
- **Startup `expect` panics before the friendly startup-error path exists** (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs:142-143`). _Trigger: first report of a blank-window crash; convert to the managed startup-error state._
- **Server writes snapshot files nothing reads** (`server` snapshots/{seq}.json; `GET /v1/snapshot` always exports fresh). _Trigger: next server touch — either wire bootstrap to them or delete the write path._
- **Server upgrade crash-loops on legacy replicas** (observed 2026-07-20 deploying V002 onto the Jul-17 server data: `V002 … no such table: pages` → systemd restart loop; resolved by the planned wipe). Pre-V002 server user replicas apparently existed in a state the fresh migration chain does not expect. Harmless while wipes are free; must be understood before the first non-wipe production upgrade. _Trigger: before importing data that cannot be re-synced from a client, or before any second user._

## Performance (post-import watch list)

- **Outliner: per-parent RPC fan-out + no virtualization** (`block-tree.tsx:32`; violates EDITOR*ARCHITECTURE.md:230). Hundreds of blocks fine, thousands hurt. \_Trigger: measure on the real imported corpus (17k blocks); fix = one batched children RPC + list virtualization. Deliberately needs a perf baseline first.*
- **Single serialized DB connection on the client** (`notes-core/src/sqlite.rs`): bulk import/export and long queries block interactive reads. _Trigger: if the Logseq import or big-page work feels frozen; fix = small read-only WAL connection pool._
- **Client search limit hardcoded at 20** with no load-more (UI). _Trigger: first time a real search needs result 21; fold into palette follow-up._

## Security / multi-user (single-user today)

- **Client sync token in plaintext `settings.json`** (0600) instead of OS keychain (`settings.rs:268-282`). _Trigger: before any shared-machine use; Android keystore is the hard part._
- **Blob GC + per-user story beyond quota** (C3 adds ownership/quota; GC of unreferenced blobs remains). _Trigger: server disk growth or second user._
- Upstream-known (README "remaining work", not review findings): oplog compaction, device registration/pairing, scoped credentials.

## UX / product

- **Enabling sync from disabled-at-startup requires an app restart**: `spawn_worker` runs once at startup only when credentials exist; `sync_settings_changed()` bumps a watch nobody loops on in that state (observed during B8 review — pre-existing, not a regression; B8's park/resume works for an already-running worker). _Trigger: first time it annoys during real use; fix = spawn the worker lazily on credential save._

- **RU/EN translated near-duplicates** both surface in semantic results (no translation-dedup anywhere). _Trigger: eval harness shows it hurting real queries; otherwise accept._
- **No sub-space/namespace filtering**: repo docs + blog + personal notes share one retrieval space; dense technical pages will dominate related queries. _Trigger: after MD import lands and pollution is felt; ties into the roadmap's properties/saved-queries plans._
- **`outliner.collapsed.<uuid>` localStorage keys accumulate forever** (`block-node.tsx:110-111`), surviving page deletion. _Trigger: trivial janitor task any time — prune keys whose UUID no longer exists at startup._

## Approved, awaiting scheduling

- **Rewrite-on-rename** (approved 2026-07-19): renaming a page rewrites all inbound `[[old title]]` links to the new title (find them via the `page_links` index on `target_title`; ordinary synced block-edit ops), behind a confirmation showing the link count. This frees old names safely (no dangling links, no silent capture when the old name is reused) and makes auto-aliasing unnecessary. Manual aliases stay as-is — they are for deliberate synonyms, not rename history. Journals unaffected (no titles). _Trigger: promote into a plan before rename sees real use — i.e. shortly after the Logseq import._

## History/undo polish (B6F4 verification leftovers, 2026-07-19 — all minor, no data-loss paths)

- Subset-apply of destructive undo scopes is shadowed by B6F2 field guards (disappeared content Skips conservatively instead of applying) — add a code comment and a test pinning whichever semantics is intended.
- Redo-direction and recursion-depth scope scenarios verified by review probes but have no committed tests.
- Theoretical downgrade hole: pre-B6F4 binaries silently drop `scope_guards` on read (same accepted class as the legacy-v1 single unguarded apply). _Trigger for all three: next time anyone touches `history.rs`._

## Design debt (needs a design session, not a task)

- **Undo boundary is inconsistent**: document edits and structure are in persistent history; outline typing undo is editor-local and dies on blur/restart (`db/blocks.rs:198` bypasses `record_action`). _Trigger: after B6 (sync-safe undo) lands — same subsystem, decide the model once._
- **`reconcileRemoteDraft` is nearly vestigial** (`editor-sync.ts`) — real reconciliation lives in the page-session registry. _Trigger: next outliner refactor; fold/remove._
- **Graph view is prototype-grade** (fixed ellipse layout, refetch-on-click). _Trigger: when the graph becomes a daily tool; consciously parked._

## Handwriting integration (2026-09-06 review, accepted for now)

- **Second pane of the same handwritten note stays read-only** after the editing pane closes; editor ownership is acquired once per mount (`handwriting-note-view.tsx`). _Trigger: first time two panes of one handwritten note are used on desktop; fix = re-acquire ownership on `pages_changed`/focus._
- **Title editing hook duplicates `PageView` logic** (`src/features/pages/use-page-title-editor.ts` vs `page-view.tsx`) — extracted without touching the text page. _Trigger: next `PageView` title change; switch `PageView` to the hook._
- **Two Back buttons on a handwritten note in compact layout**: the pane frame's Back and the editor's own Back (flush-then-leave). The frame's Back bypasses the editor lifecycle and lands on the unmount path, which also flushes and completes. _Trigger: e-ink profile UI pass (Track C of `HANDWRITING_UI_PLAN.md`); hide the frame's Back for handwriting panes or route it through the editor's `leave`._
- **`removePage` gives no cancellation signal** (`use-notes-workspace.ts`), so the editor cannot mark itself as leaving before delete; harmless today because a `not_found` completion is ignored. _Trigger: when another caller needs to know whether a delete happened; return `boolean`._

## 2026-09-07 review, deferred

Findings verified during the review that produced Track E of `HANDWRITING_UI_PLAN.md`,
deliberately left out of it.

- **Per-gesture ink I/O is O(document), and `ink_root_refs` grows with it** (`crates/notes-core/src/ink/storage.rs`, patch path): every completed gesture rewrites the whole root record and re-indexes every object it references, so the cost of one stroke scales with the note rather than with the stroke. _Trigger: the first busy-timeout save failure, or a sheet of roughly 50k points feeling slow on the tablet; fix = incremental root/ref maintenance, which needs its own design._
- **Blob ownership is never released and there is no blob GC** (`server/src/blob_ownership.rs`): a user's quota only ever grows, and blobs no operation references any more stay on disk forever. _Trigger: the first quota warning, or a second user._
- **No rate limiting on the hashing endpoints** (`PUT /v1/blobs/{hash}`, `POST /v1/ink/upload`): an authenticated caller can spend server CPU on SHA-256 without bound. _Trigger: a second user, or exposing the server publicly._
- **OAuth client registration is unbounded** (`server/src/oauth`): anyone reaching the endpoint can register clients without limit. _Trigger: same as above._
- **The floating Onyx keyboard is not handled** (`plugins/.../OnyxInk.kt`): the pause registry sees the ordinary IME through window insets, but a floating keyboard does not resize anything and reports no inset. The stock app subscribes to `onyx.action.kime.status.changed` and feeds its `floatingWindowRectList` to `setExcludeRect` instead of pausing. _Trigger: the first use of the floating keyboard over a sheet._
- **`pastey` appears twice in `Cargo.lock`** (two semver-incompatible versions pulled in transitively). Cosmetic: build time and binary size only. _Trigger: next dependency sweep._

## E-ink panel behaviour outside the app (2026-09-07)

- **Full-panel flash on every finger touch** on the Note Air 4C, in every screen and in both display profiles (Standard and E-ink). Verified with a DOM mutation observer: the WebView repaints nothing on a canvas tap, and the plugin receives no call; the firmware refreshes on touch by itself. Not controllable from the app; the per-app EinkWise refresh settings are the user-side knob. _Trigger: if a documented SDK call turns out to suppress it (compare with Chrome and the stock Notes app first)._

- **Logseq import stamps every page with the import time** (`updatedAt`/`createdAt` = 2026-07-20 for the whole corpus), so "Recently edited" ranks year-old pages by import date. _Trigger: next import touch — take the source file's mtime (and the Logseq `created-at`/`updated-at` properties when present) as the page timestamps._

## Handwriting, from the Notate study (2026-09-07)

- **Spatial index for eraser and lasso hit-testing.** Both scan every point of every stroke (up to 150k on a sheet); Notate uses a quadtree (`util/Quadtree.kt`) for O(log N). _Trigger: eraser or lasso feels laggy on a dense sheet; add a grid/quadtree index over stroke bounds in `ink-editing.ts`._
- **Scribble-to-erase.** A back-and-forth scribble over ink deletes the strokes under it (Notate `ScribbleDetector`). Works on the points we already capture. _Trigger: after the core lasso/eraser UX settles; user demand._
- **Shape recognition on dwell.** Holding at stroke end snaps a rough shape to a clean line/rect/ellipse (Notate `ShapeRecognizer`, Douglas-Peucker + scoring). _Trigger: user asks for straight lines/boxes; pairs with the dwell detector._

## Journal dates and locale (2026-09-07)

- **A `[[` link to a journal day is stored as a locale-formatted title and resolves to nothing.**
  `pageToItem` labels a page with `pageDisplayTitle`, which for a journal is
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat` output, and `block-node.tsx:417` inserts that label verbatim as
  `[[…]]`. Journal pages carry no title at all — they are found through aliases, which are the
  machine forms (`2026-01-07`, and `2022_12_29` from the Logseq import) — so the inserted
  `[[Friday, July 17, 2026]]` matches no alias and `replace_block_refs` stores a null
  `target_page_uuid`. The link is dangling on every device regardless of locale, and its text
  additionally differs between devices. _Trigger: the first `[[` link to a journal day; fix =
  insert the ISO date (which is already an alias) while keeping the formatted label on screen,
  and consider registering the formatted form as an alias too so links typed by hand resolve._
- **Journal titles follow each device's locale, so one journal reads differently on each.**
  Nothing formatted is persisted (all uses of `pageDisplayTitle` are render-time labels,
  sorting and notification text), so this is presentation only — but a workspace-level date
  format, chosen once and synced with the other settings, would make a journal look the same
  everywhere. _Trigger: user request; the setting belongs next to the display profile, and
  `formatJournalDate` already takes a `locales` argument for exactly this._
